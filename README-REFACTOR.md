# Rewritten Application Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to improve the modularity, structure, and extensibility of the Rewritten application, particularly in preparation for future LMS integration.

## Key Changes

### 1. Modular Component Structure

#### HTML Templates
- Created a component-based structure in `templates/components/`
- Extracted reusable elements (header, footer, game components)
- Established a base layout template in `templates/layouts/base.html`

#### JavaScript Organization
- Restructured JavaScript into a modular pattern with clear responsibilities:
  - `components/`: UI-specific components (game.js, scenario.js)
  - `services/`: API communication (api.js)
  - `utils/`: Helper functions (index.js)
- Created a main application entry point in `app.js`

### 2. Public API for Integration

- Exposed a clean public API through the `RewrittenApp` global object
- API enables external systems (like LMS) to:
  - Manage scenarios
  - Control game state
  - Access UI controls
  - Track progress

### 3. CSS Organization

- Set up a component-based CSS structure
- Created documentation for future CSS component development
- Maintained the existing stylesheet while preparing for future modularization

### 4. Extension Points

- Created clear extension points for LMS integration:
  - Service module templates for LMS connectors
  - Authentication integration hooks
  - Progress tracking infrastructure

## How to Extend

### Adding New Components

1. Create a new HTML template in `templates/components/`
2. Create a corresponding JavaScript module in `static/js/components/`
3. Add appropriate CSS in `static/css/components/` (future)
4. Include the component in the appropriate parent template

### Implementing LMS Integration

1. Create LMS connector services following the templates in `static/js/services/README.md`
2. Extend the `RewrittenApp` API as needed
3. Implement progress tracking and reporting
4. Add authentication bridge between the application and LMS

## Best Practices

When extending this application:

1. Follow the established modular patterns
2. Use the public API for all integrations
3. Maintain clear separation of concerns
4. Document new components and services
5. Leverage the utility functions for common tasks
